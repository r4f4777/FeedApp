# FeedApp
FeedApp is a prototype application for managing polls and votes in real-time. Developed as part of the DAT250 course, this project uses a modern technology stack including Java with Spring Boot for the backend, Svelte for the frontend, and technologies such as JWT for security, relational and NoSQL databases, and RabbitMQ for messaging.
